# BuildRoyale-RoofHack
Cheat engine thingy that lets you see through roofs in Buildroyale.io 

## Instructions: 

1.) Download Cheat Engine from https://cheatengine.org/ 

If you already have cheat engine, update to version 7.1 

*Cheat Engine tends to bundle useless bundleware, so make sure you read the installation window and make sure you are installing only Cheat Engine and not anything else if you don't want bundleware.*

2.) Download Firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ 

3.) Download "1v1.YEET.CETRAINER" 

4.) Open a SINGLE tab to [buildroyale.io](https://buildroyale.io/) in Firefox. Make sure it is the only tab running. Then, join a match. 

5.) Go to Task Manager and press the "details" tab.

## There's no support so if this doesn't work it probably won't be fixed. This was just made for fun. Also, please don't use this in competitive events.
